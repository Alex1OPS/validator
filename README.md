validator
=========
Why should you use this?

    Cross browser validation
    Deals with all sorts of edge cases
    Utilize new HTML5 types for unsupported browsers
    Flexible error messaging system
    Light-weight (10kb + comments)

As a client-side developer I tend to write all sorts of forms and fields the user needs to interact with. Lately this whole area has been somewhat “upgraded” with a bunch of new HTML5 stuff like new input types and attributes, BUT since we live in an IE world still, there is no point using the new stuff until IE will perish. This is why I rely only on my own client-side validations which are actually much smarter than the built-in ones that browsers supply.

Also, in the semantic point-of-view, I believe that this method is very clean and…appropriate. This is how forms should be. Most of the things were decided upon out of personal preferences, after pondering over almost every aspect of the matter at hands.
